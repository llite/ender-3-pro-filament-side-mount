# ender-3-pro-filament-side-mount

A set of parts to relocate the filament spool from the top of the ender 3 to the side.
Most side mounts seem to have the filament perpendicular to the machine vastly increasing the footprint. This one has the filament parallel to the machine with a filament guide.

The mount was created with topographic design so there is a cavity on the inside. I used Cura's tree supports and had no problem removing them from inside. 

The filament guide helps to make sure the filament doesn't bind on parts and is straight before entering the extruder. It is hinged with a spring to make sure it is the correct angle throughout z-axis travel. I just used a spring out of retractable pen and it works fine.

Additional parts needed:
- small spring (from retractable pen) needs to be ~28mm long with an I.D. greater than 3mm
- m4x16 bolt 
- 608 bearing or two washers and print the no bearing roller
- paper clip, this will be the pin for the hinge

For the guide there are two options, with and without the bearing. I've had no issues without a bearing but if you would like to use one there's the option.

Without bearing files:
- roller-no-bearing.STL
- hinge.STL
- mount.STL

With bearing files:
- roller-bearing.STL
- 2x bearing spacer.STL
- hinge.STL
- mount.STL

Notes:

    The mount needs a support for the spring mount
    The bracket needs support, make sure to print it with the rails parallel to the print bed but not on it.
